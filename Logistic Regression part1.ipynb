    "Univariate Selection: \n",
    "    This method involves selecting features based on their individual relationship with the target variable. Common techniques include chi-squared test, ANOVA F-test, and mutual information scores. Features that exhibit a strong correlation with the target variable are selected for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): \n",
    "    RFE works by recursively removing the least significant features and retraining the model until the optimal set of features is obtained. This method helps in selecting the most important features while minimizing overfitting and improving the model's generalizability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Importance Ranking: \n",
    "    Using algorithms like decision trees or random forests, feature importance scores can be calculated, and features can be ranked based on their contribution to the model's predictive performance. Features with higher importance scores are retained, while less significant features are discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso (L1 Regularization): \n",
    "    Lasso regularization adds a penalty term to the logistic regression cost function, encouraging the model to select only the most relevant features while setting the coefficients of less important features to zero. This technique helps in reducing overfitting and improving the model's interpretability by promoting sparsity in the coefficient values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward or Backward Stepwise Selection: \n",
    "    Forward selection starts with an empty set of features and adds one feature at a time, evaluating the performance at each step, while backward selection begins with all features and removes one feature at a time. These methods iteratively select or eliminate features based on their impact on the model's performance.\n",

    "By employing these feature selection techniques, logistic regression models can be improved in several ways:\n",
    "Preventing Overfitting: \n",

    "Improving Generalizability: \n",
    "    Selecting the most relevant features ensures that the model is better able to generalize to unseen data, enhancing its predictive performance on new observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhancing Interpretability: \n",
